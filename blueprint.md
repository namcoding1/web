# Project Blueprint: Desk-Fit

## Overview

**Desk-Fit** is a curated e-commerce store specializing in desk interior design and productivity-enhancing products. The brand targets remote workers, students, and anyone looking to create a more focused and aesthetically pleasing workspace.

**Concept:** "Your Personal Office, Perfected."

## Design and Brand Identity

- **Brand Name:** Desk-Fit
- **Slogan:** "We eliminate everything that distracts you from your flow."
- **Aesthetic:** Minimalist, modern, and professional. The color palette will be based on monochrome colors (black, white, grays) with a single, calm accent color (e.g., a deep blue or a subtle silver) to create a sense of focus and sophistication.
- **Target Audience:** Professionals, students, creatives, and gamers who value both productivity and design.

### Core Product Lineup
1.  **Aluminum Laptop Stand** (to prevent turtle neck syndrome)
2.  **Microfiber Large Desk Pad** (dust-free)
3.  **Focus Timer** (Pomodoro timer)
4.  **Magnetic Cable Organizer**

### Marketing Copy

> "The reason you lose focus isn't a lack of willpower; it's your environment. Discover the curation that transforms your desk into a space of deep immersion at Desk-Fit."

## Current Plan

This phase focuses on showcasing the brand's second core product, the "Microfiber Large Desk Pad," by updating the main product page. This demonstrates how the template can be used for different products in the lineup.

**Action Items:**
1.  Update the HTML to feature the new product's name, description, image, price, and options.
2.  Adjust the base price in the JavaScript file.
3.  Maintain the minimalist design and branding consistently.
