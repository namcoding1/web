# Blueprint: Modern E-commerce Site

## 1. Project Overview

This project aims to build a modern, responsive, and visually appealing e-commerce website, similar to Naver Smart Store. It will feature a clean user interface, a product catalog, and interactive elements, all built using modern web standards without relying on external frameworks.

## 2. Core Features & Design

*   **Homepage:** A visually appealing landing page with a hero section and featured products.
*   **Product Catalog:** A grid-based display of products with images, names, and prices.
*   **Web Components:** Product listings will be created as reusable Web Components for better encapsulation and maintainability.
*   **Modern CSS:** Utilizes container queries, cascade layers, `:has()` selector, and modern color spaces for a flexible and maintainable design.
*   **Responsive Design:** The layout will adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring a great experience on both mobile and desktop.
*   **Minimalist Aesthetic:** Clean lines, ample whitespace, and a focus on product imagery.

## 3. Current Plan

1.  **HTML Structure:** Create the basic HTML structure for the header, main content, and footer in `index.html`.
2.  **CSS Styling:**
    *   Define a modern color palette and typography in `style.css`.
    *   Implement a responsive layout using CSS Grid.
    *   Style the header, footer, and product card elements.
3.  **JavaScript & Web Components:**
    *   Create a `<product-card>` web component in `main.js` to display individual products.
    *   Use a mock data array to represent the products.
    *   Dynamically render the product cards on the homepage.
