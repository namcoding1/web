# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a single-page e-commerce product page designed to emulate the look and feel of a Naver Smart Store, a popular e-commerce platform in South Korea. It is built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, focusing on a clean, user-friendly, and feature-rich presentation of a single product.

## Design and Features

### Layout and Styling (Naver Smart Store Style)
- **Header:** A simple and clean navigation bar at the top.
- **Main Product Section:** A two-column layout featuring a large product image gallery on the left and product details, options, and purchase actions on the right.
- **Detailed Information Tabs:** A tabbed section below the main product area to switch between "Product Details," "Reviews," and "Q&A," providing comprehensive information without cluttering the page.
- **Sticky Purchase Bar:** A "Buy Now" bar that remains fixed at the bottom of the screen when the user scrolls down, ensuring easy access to purchasing options.
- **Color Scheme:** Utilizes a clean, minimalist aesthetic with a lot of white space and uses Naver's signature green (`#03C75A`) as a primary accent color for key actions like "Buy Now" and "Add to Cart."
- **Typography:** Employs clear and readable fonts, typical of modern Korean web design.

### Functionality
- **Product Options:** Users can select product options (e.g., size, color) and adjust the quantity before adding to the cart.
- **Interactive Tabs:** The detailed information section is fully interactive, allowing users to switch between different content panels.
- **Component-Based JS:** The application logic is organized into reusable JavaScript components (`Product`, `Cart`, `Tabs`) for better maintainability.
- **ES Modules:** The project uses modern ES modules (`import`/`export`) for a clean and scalable code structure.

## Current Plan

The immediate goal is to refactor the existing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement the Naver Smart Store design and functionality. This includes restructuring the HTML, completely overhauling the CSS, and updating the JavaScript components to handle the new UI elements and interactions.
